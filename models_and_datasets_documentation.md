## Usage

To use these models and datasets:

1. Load the models using TensorFlow/Keras:
   ```python
   from tensorflow import keras
   model = keras.models.load_model('model_name.h5')
   ```

2. Load the datasets using JSON:
   ```python
   import json
   with open('dataset_name.json', 'r') as f:
     data = json.load(f)
   ```

3. For Hugging Face compatible datasets, use the Hugging Face Datasets library:
   ```python
   from datasets import load_dataset
   dataset = load_dataset('path/to/dataset_name_huggingface.json')
   ```

## Future Work

- Expand datasets to include more diverse scenarios and edge cases.
- Continuously update models with new techniques in AI consciousness detection and bias mitigation.
- Develop integrated pipelines that combine multiple models for comprehensive AI security and fairness.

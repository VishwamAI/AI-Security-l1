# Advanced Bias Mitigation and AI Security Tool

## Overview

The Advanced Bias Mitigation and AI Security Tool is a comprehensive solution for addressing fairness, bias, and security concerns in AI systems. Building upon the foundations of tools like AIF360, this tool integrates cutting-edge bias mitigation techniques with state-of-the-art AI security measures, providing a holistic approach to responsible AI development.

## Features

### Bias Mitigation Techniques

1. **Reweighing**: Adjusts instance weights to ensure fairness across different groups.
2. **Adversarial Debiasing**: Uses adversarial techniques to remove bias from the model during training.
3. **Calibrated Equalized Odds**: Adjusts the model's predictions to satisfy the equalized odds fairness criterion.
4. **Reject Option Classification**: Introduces a rejection option for instances where the model is uncertain, helping to reduce biased decisions.

### Advanced AI Security Measures

1. **Zero Trust Security**: Implements a zero trust model where no user, device, or network is trusted by default.
2. **Quantum-Safe Cryptography**: Uses lattice-based cryptography to protect against potential quantum computing attacks.
3. **Differential Privacy**: Adds noise to the data or model to protect individual privacy while maintaining overall utility.
4. **Federated Learning**: Enables training on decentralized data, enhancing privacy and security.
5. **Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**: Integrates security practices throughout the development process.
6. **Threat Detection**: Continuously monitors for potential security threats in AI systems.
7. **Automated Patch Management**: Regularly checks for and applies security updates.
8. **Privacy Compliance**: Ensures adherence to data protection regulations like GDPR and CCPA.
9. **Incident Response Plan**: Provides a structured approach to handling security incidents in AI systems.

### Fairness Metrics

1. **Demographic Parity**: Ensures equal prediction rates across different groups.
2. **Equal Opportunity**: Ensures equal true positive rates across different groups.
3. **Equalized Odds**: Ensures equal true positive and false positive rates across different groups.
4. **Disparate Impact**: Measures the ratio of favorable outcomes between different groups.
5. **Individual Fairness**: Ensures similar individuals receive similar predictions.

## Installation

```bash
pip install advanced-bias-mitigation-ai-security
```

## Quick Start

```python
from advanced_bias_mitigation_ai_security import AdvancedBiasMitigationClassifier

# Initialize the classifier
classifier = AdvancedBiasMitigationClassifier()

# Fit the model
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = classifier.predict(X_test)

# Get fairness metrics
fairness_metrics = classifier.get_comprehensive_fairness_metrics(X_test, y_test, predictions)

# Get feature importance
feature_importance = classifier.get_feature_importance()

# Get explanation of bias mitigation and security measures
explanation = classifier.explain_bias_mitigation()
```

## Advanced Usage

### Customizing Bias Mitigation

```python
classifier = AdvancedBiasMitigationClassifier(
    bias_mitigation_techniques=['reweighing', 'adversarial_debiasing'],
    fairness_metrics=['demographic_parity', 'equal_opportunity']
)
```

### Implementing AI Security Measures

```python
classifier.implement_zero_trust_security()
classifier.implement_quantum_safe_cryptography()
classifier.apply_differential_privacy(epsilon=0.1)
classifier.enable_federated_learning()
```

### Comprehensive Model Evaluation

```python
evaluation_results = classifier.evaluate_model(X_test, y_test)
print(evaluation_results)
```
